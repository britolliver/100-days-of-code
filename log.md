**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress** Started a portfolio project layout on VSCode, connected my remote and local repositories, looked up courses and ideas, nothing is showing on webpage yet but it pops up

**Thoughts:** I am so sad and discouraged. I don't know if coding is a fit for me because I don't know what to do. All the resources are confusing and none are linear but I feel like I am the problem. I have no clue how to do a portfolio, or if I am ready. Should I do a course as well or just learn by doing a portfolio? I hope the whole 100 days are not like this. I have no clue what to do and no one to ask for guidance. I work and am tired. I did a bootcamp but obviously I learned nothing. Either I will finsih or I will give up. I don't know what to do. It is all too much. I think If I don't know everything I won't be able to get a job. Should I focus on one language or course? Courses are how I think I have to learn. What if there is something i don't know? But I am glad that I get to look at the fact that I did something on today's progress. That is my small ounce of hope.

I just a brekthrough and I madea  timeline and guide fro myself. It is simple and easy. Nothing complex. I am excited for this.  Will give more info tomorrow .

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
