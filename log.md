# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 5, 2021
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com) -->
**Today's Progress** Started a portfolio project layout on VSCode, connected my remote and local repositories, looked up courses and ideas, nothing is showing on webpage yet but it pops up

**Thoughts:** I am so sad and discouraged. I don't know if coding is a fit for me because I don't know what to do. All the resources are confusing and none are linear but I feel like I am the problem. I have no clue how to do a portfolio, or if I am ready. Should I do a course as well or just learn by doing a portfolio? I hope the whole 100 days are not like this. I have no clue what to do and no one to ask for guidance. I work and am tired. I did a bootcamp but obviously I learned nothing. Either I will finsih or I will give up. I don't know what to do. It is all too much. I think If I don't know everything I won't be able to get a job. Should I focus on one language or course? Courses are how I think I have to learn. What if there is something i don't know? But I am glad that I get to look at the fact that I did something on today's progress. That is my small ounce of hope.

I just had a brekthrough and I made a timeline and guide fro myself. It is simple and easy. Nothing complex. I am excited for this.  Will give more info tomorrow .

### Day 2: November 6, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Watched 15 min of JS course on YT , took notes and set up code editor and repo for that; Researched in bootcamp book about variables and other concepts in JS;did FCC JS course that goes with the YT video for 15 min; Read Java book for 15 min and set up code editor and github repo for that and made first commit; Created a wireframe and user stories for 1st project idea, set up in code editor and repo for that

**Thoughts**: I was so tired today and almost did not do anything but praise God I stuck with it. Even though I did mainly everything in 15 minute increments,except the project, because I am so tired and it is so late(2 am right now), I feel the most productive I have felt since high school. Because this is all my doing. No one is making me and no one is telling me I have to hav something turned in by Monday at 11pm. Coding is becoming less of a "get a career quicker and cheaper than college" scheme and more of something that I love, something that is mine. I am able to process and settle down now that I am not worried and overwhelmed. The articles shared in the read me helped get me here because I was ready to quit. I am excited for tomorrow(or today lol). Also glad I am going over the basics again JS and reading a Java book so I don't lose skill in it. Planning time in these areas helped ease anxiety and the feeling of being overwhelmed. i hope I learn to type fster with no mistakes. I don't think school deadlines are the best ways I learn. Still figuriong that out. I forgot to say I divided up different thngs I want to cover daily and gave them a short time limit to ensure consistency and I decided to do lots of projects, starting with simple things I learned and redid from coding bootcamp.The 1st project was inspired from bootcamp.

### Day 4: November 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: YT course, fcc course, python course

**Thoughts:** I did not complete all my tasks today. I want to watch a movie. I will pick up where I left off. I got a lot done today I think. I enjoyed and learned a lot. The python course is so cool to me. I'm creating lots of possibilities for myself in the future by learning may things. I made a game on FreeCodeCamp called Madlibs. I really liked that. Day 4 down, 96 more to go!!
